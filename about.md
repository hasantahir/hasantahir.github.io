I am currently a PhD Student at [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu/) working under the supervision of [Dr. Robert D. Nevels](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/people/rnevels). Prior to this, I was working as a lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the KSK campus of UET Lahore, Pakistan.
