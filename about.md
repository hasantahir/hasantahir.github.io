I received a PhD in Electrical Engineering at [Texas A&M University](http://www.tamu.edu/) supervised by [Dr. Robert D. Nevels](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/people/rnevels) in August 2017. Prior to this, I obtained a BSc in Electrical Engineering degree with honors from University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, Pakistan.

I have previously worked as a lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the KSK campus of UET Lahore, Pakistan.
