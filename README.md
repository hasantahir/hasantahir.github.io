First try of creating a personal website. The template was originaally forked from [svmiller.github.io](http://svmiller.github.io).

Steve's Notes on the content of the website
===========================================
Much of what is contained in here is derivative of those two works. That said, do observe the `image.html` file in the `_includes` directory. `image.html` provides fancier images than what is standard for Markdown. An example use of `image.html` can be observed in the `about.md` file.

I use data-driven navigation, which you can see in the `menu.yml` file in the `_data` directory. There's also a `nav.html` file in the `_includes` directory with modified `header.html`.

Mobile support is clearly functional, though some white-spacing could be improved. Feel free to offer improvements if you'd like.

My contribution
===========================================
Added aggie web colors from the brand guide.
