My research focuses on studying extra-ordinary wave phenomena in novel two-dimensional materials with an emphasis on developing  to the area of network control systems, which deals with the distributed control and coordination of multiagent systems. In particular, I analyze and design networked systems from a network topology perspective using constructs from graph theory and control systems. I am particularly interested in exploiting the network structure and relating the network topology based attributes to the dynamics of the agents to achieve complex global objectives through local interactions. More recently, I have expanded my research in the area of cyber-physical systems with an emphasis on the resilience and robustness of critical infrastructure networks against faults and strategic attacks, both from the theoretical and practical perspectives using game-theoretic and graph-theory based approaches.
