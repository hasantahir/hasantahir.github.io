My research focuses on studying extra-ordinary wave phenomena found in plasmonic systems with an emphasis on designing power efficient devices like optical nanoantennas and terahertz sensors. In this regard, I develop numerical electromagnetic analysis techniques using which I analyze different nanostructure topologies and materials. I am also interested in finding direct applications of plasmonic systems such as ultra-high resolution imaging schemes and super-focused mediation of electromagnetic waves.
